// The conversation header, once.
//
// It existed twice — local/react-shell.js and remote/react-app.js — in the same shape,
// with the same class names, differing in ways that were almost all accidental: the
// leading wrapper was `.chat-header-leading` on one side and `.chat-header-main` on the
// other, separately styled, and the only real difference between those two rules was a
// gap of 8px against 12px. The collapsed-actions pair and the back button were
// byte-identical apart from their ids.
//
// What is genuinely per-surface stays per-surface, as slots and ids rather than as a
// second copy of the header:
//   - remote has a drawer hamburger; local has no drawer
//   - the back button goes to the console on local and to the relay list on remote, so
//     its label and destination are passed in
//   - local wires its buttons by id from app.js and passes no handlers; remote passes
//     handlers and no id is load-bearing. Both work, because a missing onClick is just
//     undefined.
//
// Local's shell renders exactly once, so nothing here may depend on a prop that changes:
// local hands it static mounts (`#project-switcher-mount`, `#workspace-subtitle`) and
// keeps writing into them imperatively, while remote hands it live nodes. The component
// does not know or care which it got — it owns the STRUCTURE, not the data.
