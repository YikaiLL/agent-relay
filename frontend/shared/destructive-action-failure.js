// Reporting a failed archive/delete so the user actually learns about it.
//
// These two actions used to report failure by calling `logLine` alone, which
// writes into `#client-log` — a collapsed panel. The relay would refuse the
// action, the row would stay exactly where it was, and from the user's side the
// menu item had simply done nothing. That is the shape the original Cursor bug
// report took ("删除 session 完好像没反应"): the delete was failing loudly at the
// HTTP layer and silently at the only layer anyone was looking at.
//
// Making delete work does not retire the problem, it makes it more reachable:
// a real delete has real failure modes (the directory already gone, a
// permissions error, a session the relay is holding for a running turn), where
// before there was exactly one and it was constant.
//
// So the invariant is that a refused destructive action is reported through BOTH
// channels: the log keeps the record, and a modal states it. `window.alert` is
// the counterpart of the `window.confirm` these same flows already open to ask —
// answering a modal question with a modal outcome — and it cannot be missed the
// way a collapsed panel can.

/**
 * The sentence shown for a refused destructive action.
 *
 * Names the session, because the menu is opened per-row and a bare "Failed to
 * delete" leaves the user unsure WHICH one they just acted on. Falls back to a
 * generic reason rather than rendering "undefined" when a throw carries no
 * message.
