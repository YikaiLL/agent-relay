// The sidebar's destination nav — Sessions | Tasks — in both of its forms.
//
// Shared by local and remote deliberately, for the same reason `project-switcher.js`
// gives: the control is identical on both (a list of places to be), and the surfaces
// differ only in what arriving somewhere DOES, which is the caller's business. Writing it
// twice is how the two sidebars drifted before.
//
// Two exported forms, ONE destination list:
//
//   `SidebarNav`     — labelled rows, for an expanded sidebar.
//   `SidebarNavRail` — icon-only buttons, for local's 64px collapsed rail.
//
// The rail is not a second nav. It shipped with a Tasks button and no Sessions button,
// so collapsing the sidebar while on the Task screen left no way back — a gap that was
// only possible because the two forms were written separately. They now read one list, so
// a third destination joins both at once and neither can lack what the other offers.
//
// Rows rather than a two-up segmented control because a segment strip is sized by its
// member count: a third destination would re-slice every segment and invalidate the rule
// positioning the indicator, where a row just joins the stack.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This component OWNS its selected state, and does not know what routing is.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// It takes `current` in and emits `onOpen*` out. It must never learn about local's
// `session-view-state.js` (a real state machine with invariants — contexts, history, tab
// workspaces) or about remote's absence of one. That seam is the only reason one
// component can serve two surfaces whose navigation models have nothing in common.
//
// `current` also drives the `is-current` class, replacing a CSS selector on
// `.app-shell[data-view]` that existed only because the nav was NOT prop-driven: the
// paint could not wait on an imperative `aria-current` write, so the two were kept in
// step by hand from render-session. Now both come from the same prop in the same render,
// so there is one source of truth and nothing to keep in step.
