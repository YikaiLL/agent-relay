// icon-only buttons in the collapsed rail, each wired by id in app.js and each syncing
// its own "you are here" state from a different place (`aria-current` written by
// render-session, `data-view` read by CSS). This file pins the rules that let one
// component serve both forms.

// --- the re-render hazard ---------------------------------------------------------

// mousedown and mouseup resolve to the same node. These glyphs are injected with
// `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, so a re-render between the two replaces the <svg> and the
// browser fires NO click: the button hovers, depresses, and does nothing.
//
// `.inline-icon { pointer-events: none }` (styles.css) is what keeps the BUTTON as the
// hit target. Renaming the class away from `.inline-icon` silently reintroduces a dead
// button, with no other symptom — hence a test rather than a comment.
