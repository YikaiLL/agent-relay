// Open the local sessions drawer the way a user does, and require it to STAY open.
//
// The open state is owned by the thread-list store, not by the element. Every
// render writes `details.open` back from `viewingConversation || activeProjectId
// || threadList.drawerOpen` (frontend/local/render-session.js), and the store only
// hears about a change through the `toggle` listener app.js installs. app.js is a
// module, so it executes AFTER `domcontentloaded` — which is all `page.goto`
// normally waits for. Assigning `.open` from the test therefore opens the drawer
// in the DOM while the store still believes it is shut, and the next render — a
// session snapshot, a search keystroke — closes it again.
//
// What makes that expensive is that a shut `<details>` keeps its rows in the DOM.
// Count-based waits (`querySelectorAll(...).length === n`) go on passing, so the
// failure surfaces steps later at the first thing that needs a VISIBLE row: a
// timeout in a step that has nothing to do with the drawer. That was the nightly
// `browser-local-full-fake` failure, and it reproduces exactly by running the old
// helper at `DOMContentLoaded` — i.e. before the listener exists.
//
// So click the summary, let the browser fire a real `toggle`, and then hold: a
// drawer that springs shut again is the store disagreeing, and retrying the click
// is what lets it be recorded.
